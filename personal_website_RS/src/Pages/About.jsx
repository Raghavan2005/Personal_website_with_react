I have expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and NodeJS, and I've successfully built web apps for both desktop and mobile platforms. I'm also proficient in using Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and Express.js for building efficient server-side APIs.</div>
                <div className='mt-8 sm:text-sm sm:text-left text-center text-[20px] p-2'>Starting my mobile development journey at 17, I built my first Android app using Java. Now, I'm excited about Flutter's cross-platform capabilities and streamlined development process compared to Java's complexity and XML layouts. Using Dart simplifies coding, and I'm exploring frameworks like Provider for efficient state management. I'm driven to create innovative mobile apps and constantly learn new technologies. My next goal is to develop a Education app leveraging Flutter's strengths.</div>
